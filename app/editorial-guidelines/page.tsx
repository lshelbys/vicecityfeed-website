        <p>
          We are not affiliated with Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, or
          any official Grand Theft Auto channel. Trademarks belong to their
          owners. Coverage is commentary, criticism, and player reporting.
        </p>
        <h2 id="leaks">Leaks and rumors</h2>
        <p>
          Trailer analysis is labeled as analysis. Unverified dumps are not
          republished. We do not pay for stolen assets or personal data. If a
          claim cannot be sourced, it stays off the site or sits in the rumor
          bin with that label.
        </p>
        <h2 id="spoilers">Spoilers</h2>
        <p>
          Reviews and character studies may spoil story beats. In-article
          spoilers use a reveal control. Headlines should not blow a twist when
          a warning will do.
        </p>
        <h2 id="corrections">Corrections</h2>
        <p>
          If we get map facts, leak status, or attribution wrong, we update the
          piece and note the change. Email the desk via the newsletter form
          with &quot;Correction&quot; in the body.
        </p>
        <h2 id="community">Community</h2>
        <p>
          Discord and X are distribution, not sourcing. A viral clip is not a
          citation. Be kind in the comments you control; we will not host
          harassment.
